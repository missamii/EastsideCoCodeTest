### A Pinterest style layout, Eastside Co Coding Test.



- I utilized Materialize CSS for styling, buttons, div cards, and such.
- I went back and forth with Vanilla JavaScript and coded in jQuery. The jQuery works best, but the Vanilla JS not so much. I have never really coded in jQuery before until this assignment.
- Two different .js files.
sample.html file shows how I really wanted it to look.
- A server.js file was created for the backend developers. As I do have understand of backend.
